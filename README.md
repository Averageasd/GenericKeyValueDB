# Implementation of a simple key-value database 

## About
A C# project that demonstrates how to create and work with generic data structures. I ran into some problems. One of them was the generic type. In particular, I could not assign null to the T key. I ended up finding workaround without using null. 
In this project, we implemented a key-value database where keys and arrays were stored in arrays and we could get values using indexes of keys since they had same indexes.
